Hello, and welcome to this short video about opening LibInsight datasets
-->

## Two ways to open a dataset

- As a widget using a Friendly URL
- From a menu on the LibInsight dashboard

<div class="note">Notes look like this</red>

<!-- There are two ways to open a LibInsight dataset so you can enter data. Each dataset is available as a widget: just open the widget's Friendly URL to access it in a browser.

You can also choose from a list of LibInsight datasets by opening the LibInsight dashboard-->

## _Friendly URL_ method

Friendly URLs for most LibInsight datasets are listed in Confluence at <https://confluence.it.ubc.ca/display/ASMNT/How+to+access+LibInsight>
